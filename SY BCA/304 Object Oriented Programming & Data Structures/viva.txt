-> Object Oriented Programming is a programming in which we design and develop
   our application or program based of object. 
   Objects are instances(variables) of class.
-> Combining data and functions into a single unit called class and the process is 
   knownas Encapsulation.

-> Hiding the complexity of program is called Abstraction 

-> Dynamic binding is a concept in computer programming that's like a "last-minute
   decision" about which piece of code to run. Here's an easy way to understand it

-> Inheritance in computer programming is a mechanism that allows one class (known as
   the "child" or "subclass") to inherit the properties and behaviors (attributes and
   methods) of another class (known as the "parent" or "superclass").

-> polimorphisam that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a
   common parent class.

-> conio=Console Input-Output Header

-> iostream.h = Input-Output Stream Header

-> An enumeration is a user-defined data type that consists of integral constants.

-> spoce resolution to specify the scope or context from which a particular variable,
   function, or class member should be accessed.

-> A data structure is like a way to organize and store data in a computer so that it
   can be easily accessed and used efficiently

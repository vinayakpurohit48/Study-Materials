1. Differentiate between structure and class.
-->
Structure is a user-defined data type in C/C++ used to group variables under one name.
Class is a user-defined data type in object-oriented programming (OOP) that can contain
data members (variables) and member functions (methods).

2. How scope resolution operator used in different ways in object oriented
programming?
-->
The scope resolution operator is a unique operator that is used to access variables and
functions that exist within a specific scope. In C++, the scope resolution operator is
represented by two colons (::) and is placed in front of the name of the variable or
function that is being accessed.The scope resolution operator helps us in understanding
the scope of variables and functions. It helps us adjust the scope to make sure our code
works as we want it to

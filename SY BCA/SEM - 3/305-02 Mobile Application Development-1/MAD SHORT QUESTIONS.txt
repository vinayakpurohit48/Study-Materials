1. What is the difference between fixed and wireless networks? 
-->
Physical Connectivity: Fixed networks use cables, while wireless networks use wireless
communication.

Mobility: Fixed networks are stationary, while wireless networks allow device mobility.

Installation and Maintenance: Fixed networks can be costly and require cable installation,
while wireless networks are quicker to set up and require less physical maintenance.

Speed and Bandwidth: Fixed networks often offer higher speeds and greater bandwidth, while
wireless networks may have limitations.

Interference and Security: Fixed networks are less susceptible to interference and often
have simpler security measures, while wireless networks can face interference and require
additional security precautions.

2. Explain the concept of multiplexing in mobile computing. 
-->
Multiplexing in mobile computing is a technique that allows multiple signals or data streams
to share a single communication channel. It optimizes bandwidth usage by combining, dividing,
or time-sharing data from different sources.

3. What is modulation, and how does it relate to wireless communication? 
-->
Modulation is the process of encoding digital data onto an analog carrier signal for
transmission. In wireless communication, modulation varies the signal's characteristics
(e.g., frequency or amplitude) to represent binary information.

4. Define spectrum in the context of mobile communication. 
-->
Spectrum in mobile communication refers to the range of electromagnetic frequencies
allocated for wireless communication. It's divided into bands, like the radio frequency
spectrum, to accommodate different technologies (e.g., 4G, 5G).

5. Briefly explain Bluetooth technology. 
-->
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology used for connecting devices (e.g.,
smartphones, headphones) wirelessly. It facilitates data and audio transmission over
short distances, typically up to 100 meters.

6. What is Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), and what are its key components? 
-->
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is an outdated standard for accessing the internet
on mobile devices. Its key components include the WAP gateway, WML (Wireless Markup
Language), and WAP-enabled devices like mobile phones.

7. What are Mobile Agents in mobile computing, and how do they work? 
-->
Mobile Agents in mobile computing are software entities that can autonomously migrate
between networked devices to perform tasks or gather information. They work by traveling
to different devices, executing tasks, and returning with results, reducing network load
and latency.

Foundation Rule : System must be able to manage databases entirely through its relational
capabilities.

Information Rule : This rule simply requires that all data should be presented in table form.
This is basic of relational model.
all imformation (including metadata) is to be represented as stored data in cells of tables.
 
Guaranteed Access Rule : Every data element must be accessible by table name, its primary
key and name of attribute whose value is to be determined.

Systematic Treatment of NULL values : relational database must be able to handle null values
(empty fields) in a systematic way, ensuring that they do not cause any problems.
Null has several meanings, it can mean missing data, not applicable or no value. It should be
handled consistently. Also, Primary key must not be null, ever. Expression on NULL must give null.
null value must be independent from datatype

Active Online Catalog :  the all information  of database (including metadata)must be stored in
an online catalog which can be queried by authorized users.The same query language should be
used on catalog as used to query database.

Comprehensive Data Sub-language Rule : A database should be accessible by a 
language supported for definition, manipulation and transaction management 
operation

View Updating Rule : Different views created for various purposes should be 
automatically updatable by the system

High level insert, update and delete rule: Relational Model should support insert, 
delete, update etc. operations at each level of relations. Also, set operations like 
Union, Intersection and minus should be supported.

Physical data independence: Any modification in the physical location of a table 
should not enforce modification at application level

Logical data independence: Any modification in logical or conceptual schema of a 
table should not enforce modification at application level. For example, merging of 
two tables into one should not affect application accessing it which is difficult to 
achieve

Integrity Independence: Integrity constraints modified at database level should not 
enforce modification at application level

Distribution Independence: Distribution of data over various locations should not 
be visible to end-users.

Non-Subversion Rule: Low level access to data should not be able to bypass 
integrity rule to change data.

Unary Relational opeations : 
select ((symbol: σ)
project(symbol: π)
rename(symbol: ρ)

Relational Algebra Operations From Set Theory : 
 UNION (υ)
 INTERSECTION ( ),
 DIFFERENCE (-)
 CARTESIAN PRODUCT ( x )

Binary Relational Operations
 JOIN
 DIVISION

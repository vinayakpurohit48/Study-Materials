Device Management
===================

--> Device management is responsible for managing all the hardware devices of the computer system.
--> It may also include the management of the storage device as well as the management of all the input
       and output devices of the computer system
--> check status of computing devices If a device requested is free allocates it to the process
--> All these devices controllers are connected with each other through a system bus

Device management Functions
==========================
1. Track the status of each device such as disk drive, printer, plotters and terminals.
2. Use the algorithm to decide which process will get a device and for how long.
3. Allocate the devices.
4. De-allocate devices
At two level deallocation
        1) command Level : When the I/O command has been executed 
        2) Process Level :  When the process has been terminated

Characteristics of I/O Devices or Device Characteristics
=============================================

	-  Speed  : refers to how quickly it can transfer data to or from the computer system
	-  Capacity  : refers to the amount of data that it can store or process
	-  Connectivity  : refers to how it connects to the computer system. For example, a device may use a
                                                  USB, Ethernet, or Wi-Fi connection to communicate with the computer system  
	-  Interface  : 
	-  Reliability
	-  Durability
	-  Compatibility
	-  Power Consumption

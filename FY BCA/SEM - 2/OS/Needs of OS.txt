1). Resource Allocation: Since more than one program runs simultaneously on the system
and uses the CPU and memory, we need an operating system to manage the resource 
distribution among the various processes.

2). Multitasking : The OS helps to run more than one application at a time on the computer.
It plays an important role while multitasking. Since it manages memory and other devices
during multitasking. Therefore, it provides smooth multitasking on the system.

3). Interface between the user and the computer : An OS provides a very easy way to interact
with the computer. It provides different features and GUI so that we can easily work on a computer.
We have to interact just by clicking the mouse or through the keyboard. Thus, we can say that an OS
makes working very easy and efficient.

4). Managing the input/output devices : The OS helps to operate the different input/output devices.
The OS decides which program or process can use which device. Moreover, it decides the time for usage.
In addition to this, it controls the allocation and deallocation of devices.

5). Manages the memory : It helps in managing the main memory of the computer. Moreover, It allocates
and deallocates memory to all the applications/tasks.

6). Manages the system files : It helps to manage files on the system. As we know, all the data on the system
is in the form of files. It makes interaction with the files easy.

7). Provides Security : It keeps the system and applications safe through authorization. Thus, the OS provides
security to the system.

8). Acts as an Interface : It is an interface between computer hardware and software. Moreover, it is an interface
between the user and the computer.

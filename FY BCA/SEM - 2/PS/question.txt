Q1. what is variable length and fixed length

Lexicographic order : Lexicographic order is the way of ordering words based on the alphabetical 
order of their component letters. It is also known as lexical order, dictionary order, and 
alphabetical order. It is similar to the way we search for any word in the dictionary. We 
start our search by simply searching for the first letter of the word. Then we try to find 
the second letter and so on. The words in the dictionary are arranged in lexicographic 
order

The simplest difference between sort() and sorted() is: sort() changes the list 
directly and doesn't return any value, while sorted() doesn't change the list and returns 
the sorted list

Typedef : 

structure vs Union
array vs structure

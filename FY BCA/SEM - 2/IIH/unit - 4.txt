 HTML Elements (<h1>â€¦<h6>, <p>,<br>, <a>, <img>)
=============================================
1). <h1>...<h6> : hese are used to define headings or subheadings on a webpage. The <h1> tag represents the
most important heading on the page, while <h2> represents a subheading, and so on down to <h6>.

2). <p>: This is used to define a paragraph of text. It is often used to separate blocks of text and improve readability.
                Use "aligh" for better.
	eg. <p align = "right">This is right aligned</p>

3). <br> (Line break element): This is used to insert a line break, which creates a new line of text without starting a
      new paragraph. This is useful for creating lists, addresses, or poems(doesn't close)

4). <a> Anchor Element: This is used to create a hyperlink to another webpage or to a specific location on the current page

eg. <img src="img_girl.jpg">

alt:  The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate
text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due

	  	     Unit 1: Introduction to Internet
		=============================
The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.
The Internet is a short form for an interconnected network
With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone 
 Every computer in internet is identified by a unique IP address.

Evolution of Internet:
================= 
		       The Internet was developed by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf in the 1970s


Internet Services:
==============
		      Communication Services
		      Information Retrieval Services
		      Web Services
		      World Wide Web

Advantages And Disadvantages of Internet:
==================================
1. Vast knowledge base
2. Instant communication
3. Navigationally helpful
4. Online banking and finance are made possible
5. Many Job Options
6. Allows companies to grow and develop
7. Global workforce accessibility
8. Entertainment and pleasure
9. Internet of Things
10. Cloud storage
11. Online Education
12. Helpful for Students
13. Make money online

Disadvantages of the Internet:
1. This can lead to addiction
2. Bullying
3. Spam and advertising
4. Theft of identity		      
5. Extended usage may result in physical and mental problems
6. Separated from the Outside World
7. Consumes Time
8. Negatively influencing children
9. Wrong-Handed Information

1.2 Internet Connections
====================
1. Dial-up Connection
2. ISDN
3. DSL
4. Cable TV Internet connections
5. Satellite Internet connections
6. Wireless Internet Connections
7. Mobile Hotspot

Dial-up Connection
===============
		- uses telephone line
		- requires a modem
		- make a call to specific number provided by an ISP
		- the user cannot make or receive phone calls while connected to the internet.
		- The maximum speed of a dial-up connection is 56 kilobits per second (Kbps)
		- now mostly used in rural areas where high-speed internet access is not available.
		- protocols:
		1. Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP)
		2. Point to Point Protocol (PPP)

ISDN
=====

		Integrated Services Digital Network
		using the phone lines and digital signals
		speeds of up to 128 kilobits per second (Kbps) or 2 megabits per second (Mbps), depending on the type of ISDN connection.
		other features, including the ability to make multiple calls over a single line, caller ID, call forwarding, and other advanced telephony features
		techniques:
		 1. Basic Rate Interface [BRI(2B & 1D)]  
 		 2. Primary Rate Interface [PRI(23B & 1D)]
			1B(bearer) = 64kbps
			1Delta = 1 to 64 kbps 
DSL
====
		Digital Subscriber Line
		ordinary telephone lines
		technique:
		      1. Asymmetric DSL (ADSL): download speed > upload speed
		      2. Symmetric DSL (SDSL) : download speed = upload speed
		      3. High bit-rate DSL (HDSL)
		      4. Rate adaptive DSL (RDSL)
		      5. Very high bit-rate DSL (VDSL)
		      6. ISDN DSL
		A technology for high-speed network or Internet access over voice lines.
		DSL is one of the most popular ways ISPs provide broadband internet access. 

Cable TV Internet Connection
==============
				
		- provided through Cable TV lines
		- uses coaxial cable high capable
		- modem is used to access this service
		- modem comprises of two connections
			- internet service
			- TV signals
		- data transfer rate also depends on number of customers using the internet at the same time

Satellite Internet Connection
=============

		- offers high speed connection
		- two types of internet connection
			-  one way connection or two way connectio
				- one way connection, we can only download and two way use for both

Wireless Internet Connection
=============
		
		- use of radio frequency bands
		- offers a very high speed
		- obtained by either WiFi or Bluetooth
		-  Wi Fi wireless technology is based on IEEE 802.11 standards which allow the electronic 
		   device to connect to the internet.
		   Bluetooth wireless technology makes use of short-wavelength radio waves and helps to 
		    create personal area network (PAN).
Mobile Hotspot
=======

		- using Wi-Fi technology
		- can be in a private location or a public one
		- eg. coffee shop, a hotel, an airport, or even an airplane

Internet Protocols
=========
		- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
		- Internet Protocol (IP)
		- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
		- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
		- Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
		- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
=================
		
		- oriented connection protocol
		- end-to-end packet delivery
		- TCP is a reliable
		- TCP offers:
			o Stream Data Transfer.
			o Reliability.
			o Efficient Flow Control
			o Full-duplex operation.
			o Multiplexing

Internet Protocol (IP)
==========

		- connectionless and unreliable protocol
		- no guarantee of successfully transmission of data
		- must be paired with reliable protocol such as TCP
		-  transmits the data in form of a datagram or packets
		- The purpose of TCP is to provide reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between
applications running on hosts. It establishes a connection between the sender and receiver and manages the flow of
data between them, ensuring that all data is received correctly User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
===============
		
		- connectionless and unreliable protocol
		- doesnâ€™t require making a connection with the host to exchange data
		- no mechanism for ensuring that data sent is received
		- UDP transmits the data in form of a datagram.
		-  transmit small amount of data at one time
		-  contains both port number
		- The purpose of UDP is to provide fast and lightweight communication. It is used when speed is more
important than reliability or error checking, such as in real-time video or audio streaming.
File Transfer Protocol
==========

		- used to copy files from one host to another
		- establishes two different connections
			--> one is for data transfer (uses port 21)
			--> other is for control information (uses port 20)
		- The purpose of FTP is to provide a way to access and transfer files between computers
on the internet. It allows users to upload and download files to and from servers, and includes features for
authentication and security.

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
=================

		- transfers the files without authentication
		- TFTP does not separate control and data information
		- TFTP lacks in security features
		- not recommended to use 
		- The purpose of TFTP is to provide a simple and lightweight way to transfer files, especially
in situations where more advanced features such as authentication and security are not required.
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
=================

		- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
		- defines mechanism for communication between browser and the web server
		- also called request and response protocol
		- the communication between browser and server takes place in request and response pairs
		- The purpose of HTTP is to transmit data over the internet, specifically for web browsing. It is
used for fetching web pages, images, and other resources, and allows clients (such as web browsers) to communicate
with servers (such as web servers) to retrieve and display content.

ISP (Internet Service Provider)
===============

		- Internet Access
		- Domain name registration
		- Dial-up access
		- Leased line access
